            <p>We live in an era of change and progress. Technology has taken the modern dynamic world by storm. The change that sweeps across the socio-economic spectrum of our society is so impressive that what is in trend now becomes outdated after a little time.   Those who refuse to sail along the changed set-up are abandoned. The human race, the world over, appears to have made an unqualified revolution to go with and for change.
                The impact of change and development is considerably high on the young generation. It is destined to accept the new environment and contribute to the continuance of the system. This requires adequate knowledge of the system and the rapidity of change. A first-hand feel of the paradigm is extensively called for. The work of Educational Institutions is clearly cut out in this regard. They have to be in a position to provide the students with whatever is necessary to enable them to forge ahead. The inborn potential of the students should be brought to the forefront, their creativity be appreciated and nurtured; their enthusiasm be supported. An occasional pat on the back will work miracles in student achievements.
                To achieve great feats, one must have a vision and a positive frame of mind.</p>
